I know I was behind and hadn't honored my obligations due to my own fault and so many are struggling to make it and are current but need help.&amp;#160; I just wanted to share my story because you read so many bad things out there and I hope this might give someone a little hope to keep trying when they have the weight of the world on them in this situation. Don't give up...keep trying..it's not over till the court house steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Thank you Citi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- [DocumentBodyEnd:1946e64d-a8f6-46c7-bb3a-ef09bcd78c32] --&gt;</description>

My husband was in business for himself and finanacial we were on a roller coaster. When we were down citi helped us by deferment. My husband finally lost the business and found a job, life was looking up. We were paying our mortgage on time unfortunatly my husband had a syncopal episode and this is where everything went wrong. We were told by citi that we would be eligable for another deferment in October. We were unable to pay Octobers payment but were reassured that we would qualify for the deferment by a represenative. (I had wrote all names and dates down and conversations) In November we were supposed to be faxed the paperwork after we supposely qualify ater answering numerous questions over the phone with a citi rep. that fax never came it took 6 phone calls to finally get and then 2 weeks to be told we were not eligable. This was in late nov 2010. Yes 2010. At this time we spoke to a very rude supervisor who said are only option was a forbearance plan. We agreed, she gave us a figure and a date to be autowithdrawen from our account and how often. At the end of this&amp;#160; 2 month process, we were told we would be current. On Nov 30th I was contacted by citi rep looking for a payment. I told her I just made one the day before over the phone with another rep and set up a forbearance plan, she informed me that no such plan had been set up and to call her back at her extension on Dec 1st when their computers would be updated. We did and were informed that our account was going to be double debited and that they were very sorry but could we please put a stop payment on one of those transactions and mark as duplicate. We would be reinbursed for the $35.00 fee to stop payment. At this time she set up a new forbearance plan because now we were 2 months behind. The aount changed and it went for 6 months. 4 days before xmas our account was drafted again 2x causing us to be over drawen $900.00. We were devastated to be short right before xmas. Again we called and another apology and a promise to reinburse us, which did occur. Ever month our account was drafted the amount citi set up and the money was paid, we never missed a payment. However each month we recieved outragous bills from citi and each month we called only to be reassured that our last draft which was going to be taken on May 15th would bring us current. Did I mention I also have the forbearance plan drafted by citi. On May 15th our final draft was paid, we still owed for May because our mortgage due date was May 23rd. We paid it by June 6th which was our grace period before a late fee was applied. However a citi rep stated we were still short a little over $140.00, so we paid it. We were relieved according to every rep every month we were on track. After our last payment on June 6th which was supposed to be applied to May we were notified by citi that we still owed $2200.00. This had to be wrong all these months we paid and stayed in contact, all of these rep reassured us. We recieved a payment history from citi that showed over $816.00 in late fees applied after our last payment in May. They stated the forbearance plan had been cancelled in april but did not know why. We had managers apologizing telling us they "cant fiqure out the account". On July 1st we paid for June because I was in the hospital having surgery. In july we spoke to another manager who promised us we were going to be reinbursed those late fees and they would be applied to the mortgage like they should have been originally. We have names of reps, bank statements, hours of conversations and then citi sold our mortgage to another company. We hav been fighting this for over a year, we have been hung up on and we even attempted to record the call and per law we let the rep know that we were recording and she stated we could not and hung up on us. We had our new mortgage company inquire about this and they say we need to contact citi and now citi staes they no longer have the loan and we need to talk to our new mortgage company. We were decieved and have proof but cant get anyone to help. My surgery did not go as expected and I went into respiratory failure requiring a ventilator for 11 days and then a trache for 7 days. I have vocal paralysis and it has been hard to talk espeacially when most calls to citi take hours transferring and getting disconnected. We paid almost $300.00 extra a month for 5 months and then another $300.00 this should of brought us current but they applied this money to fees never authorized or explained. If someone can help We would greatly appreciate it. We our lost on what to do next. I have all documentation needed and am terribly disappointed in citimortgage for causing us such distress for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- [DocumentBodyEnd:5697171b-6eeb-4f4c-8744-2b5083d926b8] --&gt;</description>

      <title>Total Frustration!</title>
      <link>https://community.homeownersupport.com/thread/1161</link>
      <description>&lt;!-- [DocumentBodyStart:4f31a374-3274-4b40-a06a-10d6949d767b] --&gt;&lt;div class="jive-rendered-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't&amp;#160; know who else has had this happen but my experience with Citimortgage has been most unpleasant over the past couple of years.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some back ground: I'm 65 years old and live in a home we built outside of Atlanta in 2002. I put down a $120,000 down payment and financed about $215,000 with Citimortgage. Until early 2011 I had made all of my payments and was current. In mid 2010 my wife decided she wanted to move on and left our daughter, 17 years old, and me in the home. A divorce action has been ongoing since that time. In late 2010 I saw the&amp;#160; legal storm clouds on the horizon and contacted Citimortgage in writing, via email and on the phone.&amp;#160; I needed some help in trying to adjust/modify payments for 3-4 months - maybe more. My attorney fees were killing me. I'm living on my retirement. My Social Security kicked in August 2011.&amp;#160; What I had thought was going to be an uncontested divorce - wasn't. After more then a year we are still not finished. My wifes attorney has recently (Dec 2011) asked the court for permission to withdraw as her legal counsel - that's another story but she has not been cooperative with him, my attorney or in just getting this over. The end result is monthly attorney fees which are killing me.&amp;#160; In late June 2011 I was contacted by a Citimortgage foreclosure attorney and asked it I wanted to work something out. I responded in writing YES and supplied all the data they asked for - mostly financial. In July I got a letter saying my home was going to be sold on the courthouse steps in August.&amp;#160; The attorney never responded, never offered any help. I went back to Citimortgage, pleading for some help. In July I talked with someone that worked out a program for me to "get back on my feet" The deal was sign it or the house would be sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line. Since late July 2011 and for 9 payments I must pay Citimortgage nearly DOUBLE my monthly payments to stay in the house. That's right DOUBLE payments. I have all the documents to show what I was paying and what I'm paying them now.. My income has not changed. My monthly expenses have been cut to the bone but with a double payment and my attorney fees I'm living with all the lights out, gas/heat cut off and little joy for my daughter or me&amp;#160; I've sold most of our furniture, had yard sales and cashed in all my insurance to keep the house and my daughter in a safe environment. She is now in a community college - we could not afford where she wanted to go to school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The house can't be sold. We are upside down and quite honestly we have a beautiful home with a very reasonable normal payment - but right now it's killing me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My point.&amp;#160; Citimortgage offered two options: Sell on the courthouse steps in August 2011 or pay double for 9 payments.&amp;#160; Not exactly trying to help the homeowner! I have letters sent to the Citimortgage foreclosure lawyer and Citimortgage dating back to BEFORE I got into this jam in early 2011. I either got no response or some form letter saying I did not qualify for anything! Thanks. Citimortgage has not lost a dime off of my loan. It's interesting to me that the CEO talks a good game but was really offered provide no help or relief. The attitude was basically: take it or leave it. One other thing. All of the phone calls or meetings are great but get it in writing from them. I was verbally offered a modification but they never gave me any paperwork to implement it. It's like it never happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- [DocumentBodyEnd:4f31a374-3274-4b40-a06a-10d6949d767b] --&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- [DocumentBodyStart:0604c36a-3616-4f3e-b8b8-d4d33c7c8325] --&gt;&lt;div class="jive-rendered-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been honest with our mortgage lender from the beginning, too bad I cannot say the same for them.&amp;#160; One of us lost our job, the other hours cut back, but we prepared, at least we thought. After a year applied for loan mod because funds were running low.&amp;#160; Denied due to our income was considered acceptable to make payment.&amp;#160; A year later applied again (still unemployed). Told once we miss a pmt then reapply. Went on loan mod plan.&amp;#160; Did everything they asked, called weekly etc. Trial period up, no one would return calls, collections dept called at least 10 times a day even if we just talked to them.&amp;#160; Every person said something different.&amp;#160; What a nightmare.&amp;#160; All we needed was for the interest to go down, they said we didnt qualify due to lack of income. then found out loan mod payments did not go to loan, held in some holding account so now it show no payments made in 6 months.&amp;#160; Talked to FHA people, we definitely qualified for programs, bank wouldn't approve.&amp;#160; Nor will they approve a short sale, deed in lieu of, etc.. Finally I told them I give up, just tell me when I need to be out and can we do the walk through.&amp;#160; I was told that was privileged information and they could not discuss with me. Wow!&amp;#160; The more you try to do the right thing the more you get screwed.&amp;#160; My rent payment is going to be only a couple hundred less than my mortgage. It is a bigger, newer, no stress house. Thanks Citimortgage!&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- [DocumentBodyEnd:0604c36a-3616-4f3e-b8b8-d4d33c7c8325] --&gt;</description>
